('Malaria', '<p>\r\n<b>About Malaria</b><br>\r\nMalaria is a serious tropical disease spread by mosquitoes. If it isn\'t diagnosed and treated promptly, it can be fatal.\r\nA single mosquito bite is all it takes for someone to become infected.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n<b>What causes malaria?</b><br>\r\nMalaria is caused by a type of parasite known as Plasmodium. There are many different types of Plasmodia parasites, but only five cause malaria in humans.\r\nThe Plasmodium parasite is mainly spread by female Anopheles mosquitoes, which mainly bite at dusk and at night. When an infected mosquito bites a human, it passes the parasites into the bloodstream.\r\nMalaria can also be spread through blood transfusions and the sharing of needles, but this is very rare.\r\n</p>', '<p>\r\n<b>Preventing malaria</b><br>	\r\nMany cases of malaria can be avoided. An easy way to remember is the ABCD approach to prevention:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Awareness of risk – find out whether you\'re at risk of getting malaria before travelling</li>\r\n<li>Bite prevention – avoid mosquito bites by using insect repellent, covering your arms and legs, and using an insecticide-treated mosquito net</li>\r\n<li>Check whether you need to take malaria prevention tablets – if you do, make sure you take the right antimalarial tablets at the right dose, and finish the course</li>\r\n<li>Diagnosis – seek immediate medical advice if you develop malaria symptoms, as long as up to a year after you return from travelling</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nSpeak to your GP if you\'re planning to visit an area where there\'s a malaria risk. It may be recommended that you take antimalarial tablets to prevent infection.\r\n</p>'),
('Chickenpox', '<p>\r\n<b>About Chickenpox</b><br>\r\nChickenpox is a mild and common childhood illness that most children catch at some point.\r\nIt causes a rash of red, itchy spots that turn into fluid-filled blisters. They then crust over to form scabs, which eventually drop off.\r\nSome children have only a few spots, but other children can have spots that cover their entire body. These are most likely to appear on the face, ears and scalp, under the arms, on the chest and belly, and on the arms and legs. \r\nChickenpox (known medically as varicella) is caused by a virus called the varicella-zoster virus. It\'s spread quickly and easily from someone who is infected. \r\nChickenpox is most common in children under the age of 10. In fact, chickenpox is so common in childhood that over 90% of adults are immune to the condition because they\'ve had it before.\r\nChildren usually catch chickenpox in winter and spring, particularly between March and May.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n<b>What to do</b><br>\r\nTo prevent spreading the infection, keep children off nursery or school until all their spots have crusted over.\r\nChickenpox is infectious from 1 to 2 days before the rash starts, until all the blisters have crusted over (usually 5 to 6 days after the start of the rash).\r\nIf your child has chickenpox, try to keep them away from public areas to avoid contact with people who may not have had it, especially people who are at risk of serious problems, such as new born babies, pregnant women and anyone with a weakened immune system (for example, people having cancer treatment or taking steroid tablets). \r\n</p>', '<p>\r\n<b>Chickenpox treatment</b><br>\r\nChickenpox in children is considered a mild illness, but your child will probably feel pretty miserable and irritable while they have it.\r\nYour child may have a fever for the first few days of the illness. The spots can be incredibly itchy.\r\nThere is no specific treatment for chickenpox, but there are pharmacy remedies that can alleviate symptoms. These include paracetamol to relieve fever, and calamine lotion and cooling gels to ease itching.\r\nIn most children, the blisters crust up and fall off naturally within one to two weeks.\r\n</p>'),
('Common Cold', '<p>\r\n<b>About Common Cold</b><br>\r\nA cold is a mild viral infection of the nose, throat, sinuses and upper airways. It\'s very common and usually clears up on its own within a week or two.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n<b>What to do</b><br>\r\nThere\'s no cure for a cold, but you can look after yourself at home by:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>resting, drinking plenty of fluids and eating healthily</li>\r\n<li>taking over-the-counter painkillers, such as paracetamol or ibuprofen, to reduce any fever or discomfort</li>\r\n<li>using decongestant sprays or tablets to relieve a blocked nose</li>\r\n<li>trying remedies such as gargling salt water and sucking on menthol sweets</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nMany painkillers and decongestants are available from pharmacies without a prescription. They\'re generally safe for older children and adults to take, but might not be suitable for babies, young children, pregnant women, people with certain underlying health conditions, and those taking certain other medications. Speak to a pharmacist if you\'re unsure.\r\n</p>', '<p>\r\n<b>Treating a common cold</b><br>\r\nYou can manage cold symptoms yourself by following some simple advice. You\'ll normally start to feel better within 7 to 10 days.\r\n<b>General advice<b>\r\nUntil you\'re feeling better, it may help to:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>drink plenty of fluids to replace those lost from sweating and having a runny nose</li>\r\n<li>eat healthily – a low-fat, high-fibre diet is recommended, including plenty of fresh fruit and vegetables</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nYou may lose your appetite when you have a cold. This is perfectly normal and should only last a few days. Don\'t force yourself to eat if you\'re not feeling hungry.\r\nYou may also wish to try some of the medications and remedies described below to help relieve your symptoms.\r\n<p><b>Other remedies</b><br>\r\nThe remedies outlined below may also help relieve your symptoms.\r\nGargling and menthol sweets\r\nSome people find gargling with salt water and sucking on menthol sweets can help relieve a sore throat and blocked nose.\r\n<br><b>Vapour rubs</b><br>\r\nVapour rubs can help babies and young children breathe more easily when they have a cold. Apply the rub to your child\'s chest and back. Don\'t apply it to their nostrils because this could cause irritation and breathing difficulties.\r\n<b>Nasal saline drops</b><br>\r\nNasal saline (salt water) drops can help relieve a blocked nose in babies and young children.\r\n<b>Vitamin and mineral supplements</b><br>\r\nThere is some evidence to suggest that taking zinc supplements within a day of the symptoms starting will speed up recovery from a cold and reduce the severity of symptoms.\r\nHowever, there is currently little evidence to suggest that taking vitamin C supplements is beneficial when a cold start.\r\n</p>'),
('tuberculosis', '<p>\r\n<b>About tuberculosis</b><br>\r\nTuberculosis (TB) is a bacterial infection spread through inhaling tiny droplets from the coughs or sneezes of an infected person.\r\nIt is a serious condition, but can be cured with proper treatment.\r\nTB mainly affects the lungs. However, it can affect any part of the body, including the glands, bones and nervous system.\r\n</p>', '<p>\r\n<b>Treatment</b><br>\r\nWith treatment, TB can usually be cured. Most people will need a course of antibiotics, usually for six months.\r\nSeveral different antibiotics are used. This is because some forms of TB are resistant to certain antibiotics. If you are infected with a drug-resistant form of TB, treatment with six or more different medications may be needed.\r\nIf you are in close contact with someone who has TB, tests may be carried out to see if you are also infected. These can include a chest X-ray, blood tests, and a skin test called the Mantoux test.\r\n</p>'),
('alchololpoisining', '<p>\r\n<b>About alcohol poisoning</b><br>\r\nAlcohol poisoning occurs when a person drinks a toxic amount of alcohol, usually over a short period of time (binge drinking).\r\nBeing poisoned by alcohol can damage your health or even put your life in danger.\r\nIt\'s important to avoid misusing alcohol and to be aware of how much you\'re drinking and the effect this could have on your body.\r\n</p>', '<p>\r\n<b>How alcohol poisoning is treated in hospital</b><br>\r\nIn hospital, the person will be carefully monitored until the alcohol has left their system. If treatment is required, this may include:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>inserting a tube into their mouth and windpipe (intubation) – to open the airway, remove any blockages and help with breathing.</li>\r\n<li>fitting an intravenous drip, which goes directly into a vein – to top up their water, blood sugar and vitamin levels.</li>\r\nfitting a catheter (thin tube) to their bladder – to drain urine straight into a bag so they don\'t wet themselves</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</p>'),
('addisonsdisease', '<p>\r\n<b>About Addison’s disease</b><br>\r\nAddison’s disease (also known as primary adrenal insufficiency or hypoadrenalism) is a rare disorder of the adrenal glands.\r\nThe adrenal glands are two small glands that sit on top of the kidneys. They produce essential hormones: cortisol, aldosterone and adrenaline.\r\nIn Addison\'s disease, the adrenal gland is damaged, and not enough cortisol and aldosterone are produced.\r\nAbout 8,400 people in the UK have Addison\'s disease. It can affect people of any age, although it\'s most common between the ages of 30 and 50. It\'s also more common in women than men.\r\n</p>', '<p>\r\n<b>Treating Addison\'s disease</b><br>\r\nAddison’s disease is treated with medication to replace the missing hormones. You\'ll need to take the medication for the rest of your life.\r\nWith treatment, symptoms of Addison\'s disease can largely be controlled. Most people with the condition live a normal lifespan and are able to live an active life, with few limitations.\r\nHowever, many people with Addison\'s disease also find they must learn to manage bouts of fatigue and there may be associated health conditions, such as diabetes or an underactive thyroid.\r\nPeople with Addison\'s disease must be aware of the risk of a sudden worsening of symptoms, called an adrenal crisis. This can happen when the levels of cortisol in your body fall significantly due to not taking your medicines, or during another illness.\r\nAn adrenal crisis is a medical emergency and warning signs include severe nausea, confusion, fever, headache and weakness. If left untreated, it can be fatal. If you or someone you know has Addison’s disease and is experiencing severe symptoms, dial 999 for an ambulance.\r\n</p>'),
('coldsores', '<p>\r\n<b>About cold sores</b><br>\r\nCold sores are small blisters that develop on the lips or around the mouth. They\'re caused by the herpes simplex virus and usually clear up without treatment within 7 to 10 days.\r\nYou may not have any symptoms when you first become infected with the herpes simplex virus. An outbreak of cold sores may happen some time later.\r\nCold sores often start with a tingling, itching or burning sensation around your mouth. Small fluid-filled sores then appear, usually on the edges of your lower lip.\r\n</p>', '<p>\r\n<b>Treating cold sores</b><br>\r\nCold sores usually clear up by themselves without treatment within 7 to 10 days.\r\nHowever, antiviral creams are available over the counter from pharmacies without a prescription. If used correctly, these can help ease your symptoms and speed up the healing time.\r\nTo be effective, these treatments should be applied as soon as the first signs of a cold sore appear – when you feel a tingling, itching or burning sensation around your mouth. Using an antiviral cream after this initial period is unlikely to have much of an effect.\r\nCold sore patches are also available that contain hydrocolloid gel, which is an effective treatment for skin wounds. The patch is placed over the cold sore while it heals.\r\nAntiviral tablets may be prescribed for severe cases.\r\n</p>'),
('conjunctivitis', '<p>\r\n<b>About conjunctivitis</b><br>\r\nConjunctivitis is a common condition that causes redness and inflammation of the thin layer of tissue that covers the front of the eye (the conjunctiva).\r\nPeople often refer to conjunctivitis as red eye.\r\nOther symptoms of conjunctivitis include itchiness and watering of the eyes, and sometimes a sticky coating on the eyelashes (if it\'s caused by an allergy).\r\n</p>', '<p>\r\n<b>Treating conjunctivitis</b><br>\r\nTreatment isn\'t usually needed for conjunctivitis, because the symptoms often clear up within a couple of weeks. If treatment is needed, the type of treatment will depend on the cause. In severe cases, antibiotic eye drops can be used to clear the infection.\r\nIrritant conjunctivitis will clear up as soon as whatever is causing it is removed.\r\nAllergic conjunctivitis can usually be treated with anti-allergy medications such as antihistamines. If possible, you should avoid the substance that triggered the allergy.\r\nIt\'s best not to wear contact lenses until the symptoms have cleared up. Any sticky or crusty coating on the eyelids or lashes can be cleansed with cotton wool and water.\r\nWashing your hands regularly and not sharing pillows or towels will help prevent it spreading.\r\n</p>'),
('croup', '<p>\r\n<b>About croup</b><br>\r\nCroup is a childhood condition that affects the windpipe (trachea), the airways to the lungs (the bronchi) and the voice box (larynx).\r\nChildren with croup have a distinctive barking cough and will make a harsh sound, known as stridor, when they breathe in.\r\nThey may also have a hoarse voice and find it difficult to breathe because their airway is blocked.\r\nCroup can usually be diagnosed by a GP and treated at home. However, if your child’s symptoms are severe and they are finding it difficult to breathe, take them to the nearest hospital’s accident and emergency (A&E) department.\r\n</p>', '<p>\r\n<b>Treating croup</b><br>\r\nMost cases of croup are mild and can be treated at home. Sitting your child upright and comforting them if they are distressed is important, because crying may make symptoms worse. Your child should also drink plenty of fluids to prevent dehydration.\r\nA single dose of an oral corticosteroid medication called dexamethasone or prednisolone will usually also be prescribed to help reduce the swelling in the throat.\r\nIf your child has breathing problems they may need hospital treatment, such as adrenaline and oxygen through a mask.\r\n</p>'),
('diarrhoea', '<p>\r\n<b>About diarrhoea</b><br>\r\nDiarrhoea is passing looser or more frequent stools than is normal for you.\r\nIt affects most people from time to time and is usually nothing to worry about. However, it can be distressing and unpleasant until it passes, which normally takes a few days to a week.\r\n</p>', '<p>\r\n<b>Preventing diarrhoea</b><br>\r\nDiarrhoea is often caused by an infection. You can reduce your risk by making sure you maintain high standards of hygiene.\r\nFor example, you should:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>wash your hands thoroughly with soap and warm water after going to the toilet and before eating or preparing food.</li>\r\n<li>clean the toilet, including the handle and the seat, with disinfectant after each bout of diarrhoea.</li>\r\n<li>avoid sharing towels, flannels, cutlery, or utensils with other household members.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nIt\'s also important to practise good food and water hygiene while travelling abroad, such as avoiding potentially unsafe tap water and undercooked food.\r\n</p>'),
('depression', '<p>\r\n<b>What is depression?</b><br>\r\nEveryone has spells of feeling down, but depression is more than just spending a few days feeling sad or unhappy. Depression can make you feel persistently sad and down for weeks or months at a time.\r\nWhile some people believe that depression is trivial or not a genuine health problem, it\'s actually a real condition that affects around one in 10 people over the course of their lives. It impacts people of all genders and ages – including children. Studies show that around 4% of children in the UK between the ages of five and 16 are depressed or anxious.\r\nWith the right support and treatment, most people recover fully from depression.\r\n</p>', '<p>\r\n<b>Treating depression</b><br>\r\nThe first place to go is your GP – they will refer to you local talking treatments for depression that are available on the NHS.\r\nYou may also have the option to self-refer, depending on where you live, so you can go directly to a professional therapist if you\'d rather not talk to your GP.\r\n</p>'),
('dizziness', '<p>\r\n<b>About Dizziness (lightheadedness)</b><br>\r\nDizziness is a common symptom that’s not usually a sign of anything serious, but should be investigated by a doctor.\r\nThe term \'dizziness\' means different things to different people – some use it to describe feeling lightheaded or off balance, while others use it to describe a feeling that their surroundings are spinning.\r\nBecause the symptom is quite vague and can be caused by a wide range of things, it may not always be easy to identify the underlying cause of dizziness.\r\n</p>', '<p>\r\n<b>Treating Dizziness</b><br>\r\nIt’s a good idea to keep a diary of your dizziness, recording when and where you experience the problem, and take it with you to your GP appointment. It\'s helpful to note:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>what you were doing at the time of your dizziness.</li>\r\n<li>how long it lasted and how bad it was.</li>\r\n<li>whether you had any other symptoms – such as fainting, vomiting, nausea, blurred vision, headache, hearing loss or tinnitus.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nIf you\'re taking prescription medicine, your GP will probably review this to check whether dizziness is a possible side effect. If necessary, they can prescribe a different medication for you to try.\r\n</p>'),
('dystonia', '<p>\r\n<b>About dystonia</b><br>\r\nDystonia is a medical term for a range of movement disorders that cause muscle spasms and contractions.\r\nThe spasms and contractions may either be sustained or may come and go.\r\nMovements are often repetitive and cause unusual, awkward and sometimes painful postures. Tremor (shaking) can also be a characteristic of some types of dystonia.\r\nDystonia is thought to be a neurological condition (caused by underlying problems with the brain and nervous system). However, in most cases, brain functions such as intelligence, memory and language remain unaffected.\r\n</p>', '<p>\r\n<b>Treating dystonia</b><br>\r\nThere are a number of treatment techniques that can control the involuntary movements and spasms of dystonia, including medication, physiotherapy, and in some cases, surgery.\r\nThe aim is to provide relief from the abnormal movements and postures of dystonia, plus any associated pain and discomfort.\r\nIn some cases, other conditions that arise as a result of dystonia, such as stress, anxiety or depression, may also need to be treated.\r\nTreatment for dystonia should be based on the individual and their specific needs. As different people respond differently to different treatments, it may be necessary to try several options to find out which one works best.\r\nThere are four main types of treatment for dystonia. They are:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>botulinum toxin.</li>\r\n<li>medication.</li>\r\n<li>physiotherapy.</li>\r\n<li>surgery, including deep brain stimulation (DBS)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nWherever possible, physiotherapy, medication or botulinum medication will be used to treat dystonia rather than surgery, particularly in the case of children and young people.\r\n</p>'),
('ebola', '<p>\r\n<b>About Ebola</b><br>\r\nEbola virus disease is a serious illness that originated in Africa, where a large outbreak occurred in 2014-15. In June 2016, the outbreak was officially declared over.\r\nThe 2014-15 outbreak of Ebola mainly affected three countries in west Africa: Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. Some cases also occurred in parts of central Africa.\r\nAround 28,000 cases and more than 11,000 deaths were reported by the World Health Organization. This was the largest known outbreak of Ebola.\r\n</p>', '<p>\r\n<b>Treatment for Ebola</b><br>\r\nThere\'s currently no licensed treatment or vaccine for Ebola, although potential new vaccines and drug therapies are being developed and tested.\r\nAny area affected by an outbreak should be immediately quarantined, and people confirmed to have the infection should be treated in isolation in intensive care.\r\nDehydration is common, so fluids may be given directly into a vein. Blood oxygen levels and blood pressure also need to be maintained at the right level, and body organs supported while the person\'s body fights the infection.\r\nHealthcare workers need to avoid contact with the bodily fluids of their infected patients by taking strict precautions, such as wearing protective equipment.\r\nEbola virus disease is sometimes fatal. The sooner a person is given care, the better the chance they\'ll survive.\r\n</p>'),
('flu', '<p>\r\n<b>About flu</b><br>\r\nFlu (influenza) is a common infectious viral illness spread by coughs and sneezes. It can be very unpleasant, but you\'ll usually begin to feel better within about a week.\r\nYou can catch flu all year round, but it\'s especially common in winter, which is why it\'s also known as seasonal flu.\r\nFlu isn\'t the same as the common cold. Flu is caused by a different group of viruses and the symptoms tend to start more suddenly, be more severe and last longer.\r\n</p>', '<p>\r\n<b>Preventing flu</b><br>\r\nThere are 3 main ways of preventing flu:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>the flu vaccination.</li>\r\n<li>good hygiene (such as handwashing and cleaning).</li>\r\n<li>antiviral medication.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</p>'),
('foodpoisoning', '<p>\r\n<b>About food poisoning</b><br>\r\nFood poisoning is an illness caused by eating contaminated food. It\'s not usually serious and most people get better within a few days without treatment.\r\nIn most cases of food poisoning, the food is contaminated by bacteria, such as salmonella or Escherichia coli (E. coli), or a virus, such as the norovirus.\r\n</p>', '<p>\r\n<b>Treating food poisoning</b><br>\r\nFood poisoning can usually be treated at home without seeking medical advice. Most people will feel better within a few days.\r\nIt\'s important to avoid dehydration by drinking plenty of water, even if you can only sip it, as you need to replace any fluids lost through vomiting and diarrhoea.\r\nYou should also:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>rest as much as possible.</li>\r\n<li>eat when you feel up to it – sticking to small, light and non-fatty meals at first (bland foods such as toast, crackers, rice and bananas are good choices).</li>\r\n<li>avoid alcohol, caffeine, fizzy drinks and spicy and fatty foods because they may make you feel worse.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nContact your GP if your symptoms are severe or don\'t start to improve in a few days.\r\n</p>'),
('gout', '<p>\r\n<b>About gout</b><br>\r\nGout is a type of arthritis in which small crystals form inside and around the joints. It causes sudden attacks of severe pain and swelling.\r\nIt\'s estimated that between one and two in every 100 people in the UK are affected by gout.\r\nThe condition mainly affects men over 30 and women after the menopause. Overall, gout is more common in men than women.\r\nGout can be extremely painful and debilitating, but treatments are available to help relieve the symptoms and prevent further attacks.\r\n</p>', '<p>\r\n<b>Treating gout</b><br>\r\nTreatment for gout includes pain relief to help you cope with a gout attack, as well as medication and lifestyle changes to prevent further attacks.\r\n</p>'),
('gumdisease', '<p>\r\n<b>About gum disease</b><br>\r\nGum disease is a very common condition where the gums become swollen, sore or infected.\r\nMost adults in the UK have gum disease to some degree and most people experience it at least once. It\'s much less common in children.\r\nIf you have gum disease, your gums may bleed when you brush your teeth and you may have bad breath. This early stage of gum disease is known as gingivitis.\r\nIf gingivitis isn\'t treated, a condition called periodontitis can develop. This affects more tissues that support teeth and hold them in place.\r\nIf periodontitis isn\'t treated, the bone in your jaw may be damaged and small spaces can open up between the gum and teeth. Your teeth can become loose and may eventually fall out.\r\n</p>', '<p>\r\n<b>Preventing and Treating gum disease</b><br>\r\nMild cases of gum disease can usually be treated by maintaining a good level of oral hygiene. This includes brushing your teeth at least twice a day and flossing regularly. You should also make sure you attend regular dental check-ups.\r\nIn most cases, your dentist or dental hygienist will be able to give your teeth a thorough clean and remove any hardened plaque (tartar). They\'ll also be able to show you how to clean your teeth effectively to help prevent plaque building up in the future.\r\nIf you have severe gum disease, you\'ll usually need to have further medical and dental treatment and, in some cases, surgery may need to be carried out. This will usually be performed by a specialist in gum problems (periodontics).\r\n</p>'),
('coeliac', '<p>\r\n<b>About coeliac disease</b><br>\r\nCoeliac disease is a common autoimmune condition where the immune system in a person’s intestine (gut) reacts when they eat gluten – causing chronic inflammation.\r\nWhat\'s gluten?\r\nGluten is a protein found in wheat, barley and rye.\r\nGluten is found in food and drink that contains wheat, barley and rye, such as:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>most types of bread.</li>\r\n<li>pasta.</li>\r\n<li>cakes.</li>\r\n<li>biscuits.</li>\r\n<li>many breakfast cereals.</li>\r\n<li>pastry.</li>\r\n<li>certain types of sauces.</li>\r\n<li>some types of ready meals.</li>\r\n<li>most beers and lagers.</li>\r\n<li>certain fruit squashes.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</p>', '<p>\r\n<b>Treatment</b><br>\r\nCoeliac disease can be effectively treated with a gluten-free diet.

('hepatitisA', '<p>\r\n<b>About hepatitis A</b><br>\r\nHepatitis A is a liver infection caused by a virus that\'s spread in the poo of an infected person.\r\nIt\'s uncommon in the UK, but certain groups are at increased risk. This includes travellers to parts of the world with poor levels of sanitation, men who have sex with men, and people who inject drugs.\r\nHepatitis A can be unpleasant, but it\'s not usually serious and most people make a full recovery within a couple of months.\r\nSome people, particularly young children, may not have any symptoms. But hepatitis A can occasionally last for many months and, in rare cases, it can be life-threatening if it causes the liver to stop working properly (liver failure).\r\n</p>', '<p>\r\n<b>Treatments for hepatitis A</b><br>\r\nThere\'s currently no cure for hepatitis A, but it will normally pass on its own within a couple of months.

They can prescribe medications to help with itchiness, nausea or vomiting, if necessary.\r\n</p>'),
('hepatitisB', '<p>\r\n<b>About hepatitis B</b><br>\r\nHepatitis B is an infection of the liver caused by a virus that\'s spread through blood and body fluids.\r\nIt often doesn\'t cause any obvious symptoms in adults and typically passes in a few months without treatment, but in children it often persists for years and may eventually cause serious liver damage.\r\nHepatitis B is less common in the UK than other parts of the world, but certain groups are at an increased risk. This includes people originally from high-risk countries, people who inject drugs, and people who have unprotected sex with multiple sexual partners.\r\nA hepatitis B vaccine is available for people at high risk of the condition.\r\n</p>', '<p>\r\n<b>Treatments for hepatitis B</b><br>\r\nTreatment for hepatitis B depends on how long you\'ve been infected for:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>if you\'ve been exposed to the virus in the last few days, emergency treatment can help stop you becoming infected.</li>\r\n<li>if you\'ve only had the infection for a few weeks or months (acute hepatitis B), you may only need treatment to relieve your symptoms while your body fights off the infection.</li>\r\n<li>if you\'ve had the infection for more than 6 months (chronic hepatitis B), you may be offered treatment with medicines that can keep the virus under control and reduce the risk of liver damage.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nChronic hepatitis B often requires long-term or lifelong treatment and regular monitoring to check for any further liver problems.\r\n</p>'),
('hepatitisC', '<p>\r\n<b>About hepatitis C</b><br>\r\nHepatitis C is a virus that can infect the liver. If left untreated, it can sometimes cause serious and potentially life-threatening damage to the liver over many years.\r\nHowever, with modern treatments it\'s often possible to cure the infection and most people with it will have a normal life expectancy.\r\nIt\'s estimated that around 215,000 people in the UK have hepatitis C.\r\nYou can become infected with it if you come into contact with the blood of an infected person.\r\n</p>', '<p>\r\n<b>Treatments for hepatitis C</b><br>\r\nHepatitis C can be treated with a combination of medicines that stop the virus multiplying inside the body. These usually need to be taken for several months.\r\nMost people will take 2 main medications called pegylated interferon (a weekly injection) and ribavirin (a capsule or tablet), although newer tablet-only treatments are likely to replace the interferon injections for most people in the near future.\r\nThese newer hepatitis C medications have been found to make treatment more effective. They include simeprevir, sofosbuvir and daclatasvir.\r\nUsing the latest medications, up to 90% or more of people with hepatitis C may be cured. However, it\'s important to be aware that you won\'t be immune to the infection and should take steps to reduce your risk of becoming infected again \r\n</p>'),
('hiv', '<p>\r\n<b>About HIV</b><br>\r\nHIV is a long term health condition which is now very easy to manage. HIV stands for human immunodeficiency virus. The virus targets the immune system and if untreated, weakens your ability to fight infections and disease.\r\nNowadays, HIV treatment can stop the virus spreading and if used early enough, can reverse damage to the immune system.\r\nHIV is most commonly transmitted through having unprotected sex with someone with HIV who isn\'t taking HIV treatment. Unprotected sex means having sex without taking HIV PrEP or using condoms.\r\n</p>', '<p>\r\n<b>Treating and living with HIV</b><br>\r\nTreatments for HIV are now very effective, enabling people with HIV to live long and healthy lives.\r\nMedication, known as antiretrovirals, work by stopping the virus replicating in the body, allowing the immune system to repair itself and preventing further damage. These medicines usually come in the form of tablets, which need to be taken every day.\r\nHIV is able to develop resistance to a single HIV drug very easily, but taking a combination of different drugs makes this much less likely. Most people with HIV take a combination of 3 antiretrovirals (although some people take 1 or 2) and it\'s vital that the medications are taken every day as recommended by your doctor.\r\nTaking a number of different drugs doesn’t always mean taking many tablets though as some drugs are combined together into one tablet.\r\nFor people living with HIV, taking effective antiretroviral therapy (where the HIV virus is \'undetectable\' in blood tests) will prevent you passing on HIV to sexual partners.\r\nIt\'s extremely rare for a pregnant woman living with HIV to transmit it to their babies, provided they receive timely and effective antiretroviral therapy (ART) and medical care. An HIV test is routinely offered to all women in Scotland as part of antenatal screening.\r\n</p>'),
('headlice', '<p>\r\n<b>About head lice</b><br>\r\nHead lice are tiny insects that live in hair. Nits are the empty egg cases attached to hair that head lice hatch from.\r\nHead lice are a common problem, particularly in school children aged 4-11.\r\nThey\'re largely harmless, but can live in the hair for a long time if not treated and can be irritating and frustrating to deal with\r\n</p>', '<p>\r\n<b>Preventing head lice</b><br>\r\nIt\'s very difficult to prevent head lice.\r\nYou may want to consider regular detection combing – for example, on a weekly basis – if you\'re concerned about your children or yourself.\r\nLotions and sprays don\'t prevent head lice and should only be used if a live louse has been found in your or your child\'s hair.\r\nStaying off work or school and washing clothing and bedding on a hot wash is unnecessary, as it\'s unlikely to help prevent the spread of head lice.\r\n</p>'),

See obesity for more information about the main problems associated with overnutrition.\r\n</p>', '<p>\r\n<b>Treating malnutrition</b><br>\r\nDepending on what\'s caused a person to become malnourished and how severe it is, treatment may be carried out at home or in hospital.\r\nDietary changes are the main treatment for malnutrition. If you\'re undernourished, you may need to increase the nutritional content of your food, with or without taking nutritional supplements.\r\nIf you\'re unable to eat enough to meet your nutritional needs you may need:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>a feeding tube to provide nutrients directly into your digestive system.</li>\r\n<li>a drip to provide nutrients and fluids directly into a vein.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</p>'),
('meningitis', '<p>\r\n<b>About meningitis</b><br>\r\nMeningitis is an infection of the protective membranes that surround the brain and spinal cord (meninges).\r\nIt can affect anyone, but is most common in babies, young children, teenagers and young adults.\r\nMeningitis can be very serious if not treated quickly. It can cause life-threatening blood poisoning (septicaemia) and result in permanent damage to the brain or nerves.\r\nA number of vaccinations are available that offer some protection against meningitis.\r\n</p>', '<p>\r\n<b>Treatments for meningitis</b><br>\r\nPeople with suspected meningitis will usually have tests in hospital to confirm the diagnosis and check whether the condition is the result of a viral or bacterial infection.\r\nBacterial meningitis usually needs to be treated in hospital for at least a week. Treatments include:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>antibiotics given directly into a vein\r\n<li>fluids given directly into a vein\r\n<li>oxygen through a face mask\r\n</ul>\r\nViral meningitis tends to get better on its own within 7 to 10 days and can often be treated at home.

It\'s not usually a serious condition, but it does need to be treated.\r\nThe 2 most widely used treatments for scabies are permethrin cream and malathion lotion (brand name Derbac M). Both medications contain insecticides that kill the scabies mite.\r\nPermethrin 5% cream is usually recommended as the first treatment. Malathion 0.5% lotion is used if permethrin is ineffective.\r\nIf your partner has been diagnosed with genital scabies, to avoid reinfection you should visit your nearest sexual health clinic so you can be checked and, if necessary, treated.\r\nAvoid having sex and other forms of close bodily contact until both you and your partner have completed the full course of treatment.\r\n</p>'),
('shingles', '<p>\r\n<b>About shingles</b><br>\r\nShingles, also known as herpes zoster, is an infection of a nerve and the skin around it.

Most cases of shingles last around two to four weeks.\r\nTreatment for shingles can include:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>covering the rash with clothing or a non-adherent (non-stick) dressing to reduce the risk of other people becoming infected with chickenpox - as it\'s very difficult to pass the virus on to someone else if the rash is covered.</li>\r\n<li>painkilling medication, - such as paracetamol, ibuprofen or codeine.</li>\r\n<li>antiviral medication to stop the virus multiplying - although not everyone will need this.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</p>'),
('strokes', '<p>\r\n<b>About strokes</b><br>\r\nA stroke is a serious, life-threatening medical condition that occurs when the blood supply to part of the brain is cut off.\r\nStrokes are a medical emergency and urgent treatment is essential because the sooner a person receives treatment for a stroke, the less damage is likely to happen.\r\nIf you suspect that you or someone else is having a stroke, phone 999 immediately and ask for an ambulance.\r\n</p>', '<p>\r\n<b>Treating strokes</b><br>\r\n<b>Treating ischaemic strokes</b><br>\r\nIf you have had an ischaemic stroke, a combination of medications to treat the condition and prevent it from happening again will usually be recommended.\r\nSome of these medications will need to be taken immediately and only for a short time, while others may only be started once the stroke has been treated and may need to be taken in the long-term.\r\n\r\n<b>Thrombolysis</b><br>\r\nIschaemic strokes can often be treated using injections of a medication called alteplase that dissolves blood clots and restores the flow of blood to the brain. This use of \'clot-busting\' medication is known as thrombolysis.\r\nAlteplase is most effective if started as soon as possible after the stroke occurs and is not generally recommended if more than four-and-a-half hours have passed, because it\'s not clear how beneficial it is when used after this time.\r\nHowever, before alteplase can be used, it is very important that a brain scan to confirm a diagnosis of an ischaemic stroke is carried out because the medication can make the bleeding that occurs in haemorrhagic strokes worse.\r\n\r\n<b>Antiplatelets</b>,br>\r\nMost people will also be offered a regular dose of aspirin which – as well as being a painkiller – makes the cells in your blood called platelets less sticky, reducing the chances of another clot forming.\r\nIn addition to aspirin, other antiplatelet medicines such as clopidogrel and dipyridamole are also available.\r\n</p>'),
